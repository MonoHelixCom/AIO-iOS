# DataFeeds - A Feed Monitor for Adafruit.io

iOS/tvOS app for showing data from feeds on Adafruit IO

## Dependencies:

1. SwiftyJSON: https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON

2. Charts: https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts

Clone this repo, then in the created folder clone the repo of these two other projects. 
The workspace has a reference to the SwiftyJSON file from the SwiftyJSON project (looks in the SwiftyJSON-master folder, so if you don't have it, rename SwiftyJSON to SwiftyJSON-master), and the Charts project (add the Charts.xcodeproj to the project and to the Embedded binaries).
